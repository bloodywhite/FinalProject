								<h2>The Subtle Knife</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The book starts with the introduction of Will, who takes his ill mother, Elaine, to Mrs Cooper, Will’s old piano teacher. Elaine Parry is mentally unstable, and Mrs Cooper’s home is a safe place for her to stay. Upon Will’s return home, he realizes that several mysterious agents are looking for his father’s letters. Will finds the letters, and while escaping with them, he accidentally kills one of the men.</p>
							<p>After leaving home, Will finds himself in the streets, trying to evade the agents. Soon, he sees a cat that bears resemblance to his own cat, Moxie. The cat jumps through an invisible window in mid air. Will follows the cat, and appears in a seemingly deserted city of Cittagaze, located in another world. Will looks around the city, and finally seeks refuge in an empty house. There, he meets a ragged looking girl around his age called Lyra and her animal daemon Pantalaimon, who came from yet another world though a similar hole in the air created by her father, Lord Asriel. At first they are unsure of each other, as they have completely different backgrounds, yet with time they become friends, as they learn they both come from Oxford, albeit in different worlds. Soon, they meet some children, and learn that the city they found themselves in is haunted by Spectres – creatures invisible for pre-adolescents, yet dangerous towards the adults. Lyra consults her Alethiometer, a mysterious device that reveals truth, and learns that Will makes a courageous companion, because he managed to kill somebody.</p>
